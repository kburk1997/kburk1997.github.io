I am a junior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York studying Computer and Systems Engineering.

My passion for technology began when I was just six years old. Since then, the projects I would build have all been inspired by the unique way I see the world. Most of my experience is with webdev and hardware, but I also have experience with iOS and Android.
