I am a senior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York studying Computer and Systems Engineering.

My passion for technology began when I was just six years old. I always enjoyed the process of learning new technologies and building new projects. During college, I discovered a way to use this passion to give back to the community as a whole: through open source. I now am an active contributor to the YACS project and a mentor of RPI's open source community. I occasionally do venture into other side projects (which can be seen on my portfolio), whether they be hackathon projects or external open source projects. These contributions and side ventures are why I started a blog on this website: to document my journey, my progress, my involvement with the community.
