My first semester at RPI was crazy, but that didn't stop me from doing most of the front-end work for this project.

I implemented the web page using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and so far we have prototypes of the tip page, the crowd fund page, the campaign page, and the home page. I am hoping that next semester we could learn about dynamic web pages so that I could have web pages for each submitted campaign.

Overall, I'm pretty glad that I joined this project as it has been a rewarding experience for me, and hopefully I will be working on this project for credit next semester.

In the mean time, if you would like to contribute next semester, feel free to email one of us at burkhk@rpi.edu or bocaaust@gmail.com!
