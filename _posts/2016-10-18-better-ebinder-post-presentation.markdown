I presented on Friday and, following my mentor's advice on cutting the second demo, it went very well!

Now, I have to figure out what I can get done by the end of the semester.

Over the weekend, I realized I had quite a bit of work that needed to be done with regards to documentation.

Now, the API documentation is done for the backend, so now I have to start documenting the frontend. I'm thinking about creating a style guide using an existing platform so that I don't have to start from scratch.

Also, I plan on making a few simple frontend mockups so that I can allow the new team member to contribute to the project meaningfully without getting too overwhelmed.

I remember my first semester where I was just so intimidated by the PHP forms my partner built and I had no clue how to build non-static pages.

What I would tell my freshman self at this point is to start small and just learn as much as I can. I did a few frontend templates first semester, and spent my winter break just learning full-stack so I could have some clue on how to build non-static pages. My second semester, and my first semester doing RCOS for credit, I slowly started with some Django tutorials, and before I knew it I had fleshed out an entire backend.

Right now I'm stuck on a bug with displaying user binders, so right now I'm pretty lost after going through literally pages of StackOverflow results and finding nothing that can remotely fix this bug.
