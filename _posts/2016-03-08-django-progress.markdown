I have moved from front-end developer to full-stack developer! We are doing our backend in Django and I have pretty much all the templates done! Now I need to implement the MVC functionality and integrate with the database.

Last semester I stated that I hoped that next semester I could learn about dynamic web pages, and learning Django over winter break has helped me immensely.

We are on track to present our progress on March 25th and we are aiming for a test run with Public Safety around April-May.

I am working on this project for credit this semester, so I have been much more active with this project and I am very excited to see where it goes.
