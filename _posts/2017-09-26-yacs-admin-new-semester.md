As I promised in my earlier blog post this afternoon, I would publish my YACS blog post today! This post outlines a brief recap of last semester and a somewhat detailed plan of this semester as well as a status report.

You can find the blog post [here](https://yacs-rcos.github.io/2017/yacs-admin-new-semester).
