Since we've presented, we've made quite a bit of progress including:
<ul>
<li>Redesigned tip form to comply with Troy Public Safety and be Bootstrap-compatible</li>
<li>Got our local test up on the server</li>
<li>More standardized form parent template to avoid repeating code</li>
<li>Fixed staticfiles bug</li>
</ul>
We have a meeting with Public Safety on May 3rd to discuss our project and plans to have a test version for Fall 2016. Initially we were going to test sometime this month, but the server integration is taking much longer than expected and we have been busy with other courses.

The following day, we are presenting a poster summarizing our project at the Undergraduate Research Symposium. We are very excited to share our progress with the Rensselaer community as a whole and receive feedback.

Other than that, we are very excited to see how our test run will go this fall!
