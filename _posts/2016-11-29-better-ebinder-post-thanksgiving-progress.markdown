Haven't been able to do much due to exams and Thanksgiving break.

However, I have fixed a bug with the navbar and I am migrating the documentation and contribution guide into the website!

I still have to do an external contribution, and I feel like RCOS is a lot more work this semester, especially leading my own project.

Next semester, I am planning on mentoring, and I will be taking IED, so I might drop down to 3 credits if this is how much work 4 credits is going to be.

Last semester, there were no official guidelines for credit, and I as well as many people took advantage of the "easy A". Guess this course is a lot more demanding now.
